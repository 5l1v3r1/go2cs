These files are added as embedded resources to the primary go2cs executable. The actual source files are located in the goutil shared project.
Embedded resources found in this namespace are scanned and compared to existing files in target Go source path at startup and updated as needed.
To add new embedded resources to go2cs when new files are added to goutil, manually edit go2cs.csproj file.
